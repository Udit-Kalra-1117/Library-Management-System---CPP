# Library-Management-System---Cpp-

This repository contains the c++ code for library management system.
This mini project was done by myself during my Sem 3 on 28 July 2021.
In this mini project the book name along with its author name is taken as input, the user gets an option to search the desired book according to its name or even by the name of its author or else the librarian can print the sorted list of the books according to their name.
